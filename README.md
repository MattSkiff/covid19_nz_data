# covid19_nz_data
A simple shiny app to view covid data scraped from the MoH website

Data is left unprocessed as it is not clear what kind of structure MoH is imposing on their data. Hence all unique character levels are treated as factor levels, ordered, then plotted. If there is something you would like me to add, please let me know. However, the goal here is just to scrape the MoH data and throw up some plots, not integrate muliple data sources.

update: John Hopkins University CSSE data has been added as a time series plot
