# COVID19 NZ Data Explorer

UPDATE: The Ministry of Health / ESR now provides a dashboard for COVID19 data:
https://nzcoviddashboard.esr.cri.nz/

A shiny app to view covid19 data scraped from the MoH website. This app is not official in any way shape or form and is a personal project. All data is now sourced from the Ministry of Health.

Update: The Ministry of Health now has some charts and a map available on their website.

DHB boundaries are from 2015 and sourced from the Statistics NZ datafinder tool. The .shp file has had the geometry optimised to improve leaflet load time.

This application will not be developed further. 

If there is something you would like me to add, please let me know.

## Features

* A 3D world map showing the locations of cases prior to getting coronavirus - removed, MOH no longer publishes country of origin data
* Univariate breakdowns - age, gender, dhb, ethnicity
* Bivariate breakdowns
* Searchable tables of information (cluster,age,raw data, dhb, etc)
* NZ Choropleth with markers showing cases by DHB
* Basic time series plots of new and cumulative cases
* Cumulative time series by region
